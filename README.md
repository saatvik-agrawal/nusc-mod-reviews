## How to use

1. Initial Conversion with 1.py: Start by running the script 1.py. This script takes the original Excel file containing the course reviews and transforms it into a new Excel sheet with shortened column headers. This prevents errors down the line.
2. Generating the Word Document with latest 3.py: Next, execute the script 2c.py. This script is responsible for creating a Word document from the modified Excel sheet. The document will contain all the responses arranged in the layout we have predefined.

2.py files are intermediate scripts that dont format the text in the word file. They don't need to be used.
